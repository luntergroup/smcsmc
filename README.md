SMCSMC (Sequential Monte Carlo for the Sequential Markovian Coalescent) or SMC2 is a program for inferring population history from multiple genome sequences. It includes both a python package `smcsmc` and a command line interface `smc2` along with two backend binaries `smcsmc`/`scrm`.

For examples and explaination, please see the documentation [online](https://smcsmc.readthedocs.io) or in `docs/`.

## Installation

This repository contains two components, and both must be installed to properly use `smcsmc`.

### Recommended Installation via `conda`

> NOTE: We currently only support `conda` installation on **64 bit Linux**.  If you are using a different operating system you must install manually -- see below. 

We have automated this process in a `conda` package, and we highly recommend installing it this way.

```sh
conda install -c conda-forge -c luntergroup smcsmc
```


We must add `conda-forge` as a channel (with the `-c` flag) because the Boost version there is more current than default channels. 

### Installation from Source

Alternatively, a combination of `cmake` and `pip` can be used to install the python and core components:

#### Obtain the code

```sh
git clone git@github.com:luntergroup/smcsmc.git git-smcsmc
cd git-smcsmc
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

#### Install dependencies

Download and install the following packages (or use a package manager):

- boost
- cmake
- tcmalloc

#### Install the c++ backend

```sh
mkdir build; cd build
cmake ..
make
cd ..
```

#### Install the frontend

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install .
```
