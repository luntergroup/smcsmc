Introduction
============


SMCSMC, short for :term:`Sequential Monte Carlo<Particle Filter>` for the :term:`Sequentially Markovian Coalescent`, is a method for estimating ancestral population size and migration history from sequence data. It has several advantages over comparable methods, especially when inferring asymetric migration models. 

The method uses a :term:`particle filter<Particle Filter>` to approximate the state space of trees along the sequence and :term:`Variational Bayes` to infer epoch specific :term:`demographic parameters<Demographic Parameters>` over a given number of iterations. 

:code:`smcsmc` takes as input optionally phased sequencing data formatted as segments, and provides utilities for analysing and visualising the inferred ancestral rates.


Installation
-----------

We *highly* recommend installing SMCSMC from :code:`conda`, as it comes packaged with all necessary dependencies. A seperate guide for manual compilation may be found `in the developer reference <https::github.com>`_\ .  `See here <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html>`_ for a helpful guide to installing and using :code:`conda` to manage programs. 

First add both :code:`conda-forge` and :code:`terhorst` to your channel lists (if they are not there already), then install :code:`smcsmc`. 

.. code-block:: bash

   conda --add channel conda-forge
   conda --add channel terhorst

   conda install smcsmc


Basic Usage
----------

To use SMCSMC, start a :code:`python` session and import the :code:`smcsmc` module. As a part of the installation above, two binaries are installed into the :code:`conda-bin`, `smcsmc` (inference) and `scrm` (simulation). The front end, :code:`smcsmc` is a wrapper around these binaries providing convenient functions for data manipulation, conversion, plotting, and utilities surrounding the workflow for analysing sequences with SMCSMC. With a test seg file such as `this one <https://github.com>`_\ , the following will run a default session of SMCSMC.

.. code-block:: python

        import smcsmc

        test_args = {
                `seg`: `test_seg.seg`,
                `nsam`: 4
        }

        smcsmc.utils.run_smcsmc(test_args)
                        

Follow the :ref:`getting_started` guide to become familiar with the basic structure and function of SMCSMC commands, then look at one of the tutorials for analysing simulated or real data. For a more complete guide to arguments, see :ref:`args`.

Other Methods
------------

SMCSMC is part of the `PopSim consortium <https://github.com/popgensims>`_\ , and we are actively involved in building a framework to standardize population genetic analyses. Part of this involves making it easy to run the same analysis with many different methods. We have built :code:`smcsmc` with this goal in mind. For the latest information about comparisons between different population genetic software, including :code:`smc++`, :code:`stairwayplot`, :code:`msmc`, and :code:`dadi/fastcoal`, check out the `PopSim analysis repository <https://github.com/popgensims/analysis>`_\ .
