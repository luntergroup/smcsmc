Command Line Interface
----------------------

An entirely equivalent command line interface (CLI), called :code:`smc2`, may be used in place of the :code:`python` API. It is installed into the :code:`conda` bin (and alternatively given in the root of the repository).

For a full listing of arguments, type :code:`smc2 -h` into a terminal, or alternatively see :ref:`args`.
